## Introduction

Anime Scheduler is an iOS app that schedules users' anime (_Japanese animated shows_) according to their preference: users can either provide a specific date range or the number of episodes to be watched a day. The app utilizes a [REST API](https://jikan.moe) to obtain data of various anime, which is then displayed to users. Moreover, the anime scheduler app provides a calendar interface the user can take advantage of to view the number of episodes to be watched on a specific day. Lastly, the app displays statistics in order for the users to have a better understanding on how much time they're spending on watching anime.
